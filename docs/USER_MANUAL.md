## 1. Welcome to KelionAI

KelionAI is your premium AI companion — a 3D avatar that sees you, hears you, remembers you, and helps you with anything.

KelionAI is NOT: A doctor, lawyer, or financial advisor. Not a replacement for professional services. Not a data collection tool.

KelionAI IS: Your super-intelligent personal assistant. A companion that remembers everything across sessions. Available 24/7 in 6 languages. Created by AE Design, from AE's original idea.

## 2. Getting Started

### First Visit (No Account)
When you first open KelionAI, the camera will silently detect your face. Kelion will greet you: "Hello! I'm Kelion. I don't think we've met. What's your name?" You get 5 free messages to try. No account needed.

### Creating an Account
Say: "Kelion, I want an account" or type it. Kelion asks: email, password, verify via email code.

### Logging In
Face Login (automatic): Camera recognises you and logs you in. No email, no password needed.
Voice/Text Login: Say "I have an account" and provide credentials.

### Logging Out
